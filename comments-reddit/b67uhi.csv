shiruken,You probably should reset your `client_id` and `client_secret` since you just posted them publicly.,5,ejihzpa
Watchful1,"So you're saying it prints out the error, but then keeps running to the next line where you print it out? Or are you saying just printing out `print(redditor.comment_karma)` works?",1,ejij8z4
indiebryan,"Oops!  Thanks, its late here and I posted without thinking.  The app is just for learning and won't be used anyways, but I'll delete/recreate the app now, good catch!",3,ejiicdh
indiebryan,"So it is running on a Flask dev server locally.  The r_karma variable functions properly, for example I can print it out below the code I pasted above, or even display it on a webpage and it is correct, but I am confused as to why I am also getting a 404 response whenever I access the comment_karma and link_karma attributes but not the .name attribute",1,ejijgon
Watchful1,"I'm fairly sure the name attribute gets populated in the constructor, so there's no need for praw to make a request when you access it. But the comment_karma one isn't, so it makes a request to reddit when you access it.

I still don't really understand how you are able to access variables after it crashes.",4,ejikfwm
gavin19,"If it throws an error then the script would exit, so how are you able to access `r_karma` after the fact?

What if you just try that snippet in the REPL? Like

    import praw

    r = praw.Reddit(...)
    print(r.redditor(""bboe"").comment_karma)",2,ejikebk
