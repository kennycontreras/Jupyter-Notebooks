Watchful1,"Praw [currently has a bug](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/issues/1043) with streaming r/all. Well more correctly reddit has a bug with r/all, but praw isn't working around that bug properly. The end result is a lot of missed comments if you try to stream it.

Your best options are to wait for praw to update, manually implement the suggested fix in that github issue, or switch to using pushshift for finding the keyword.

As an aside, how did you end up with that formatting in your post? Where each line is surrounded by \` marks?",10,ejz5do9

Watchful1,"Hmm, so you didn't do anything to add them? I know the new web interface has code block buttons, but I didn't think they would do it like that.",4,ejz6dna
C0NSTABEL,I copy pasted and then clicked the “inline code” button in the pc browser post editor,3,ejz6hs5
Watchful1,"Ahha. I should complain to r/redesign about that. It doesn't do what it's supposed to do at all.

If you click ""code block"" instead, it's formatted much more cleanly.",4,ejz6o45
