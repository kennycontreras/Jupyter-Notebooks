ketralnis,"Not the way you describe, but there are other options. Some ideas:

1. You make a link to /message/compose with your bot and some sort of command string pre-filled out. Your bot polls its inbox, parses the messages, and replies
2.  You run a web server somewhere. You make links to that instead
3. You compute that result periodically, and update a subreddit wiki page with it every time you run (this works well if it's a leader board or something relatively constant)",6,ek0dml3
