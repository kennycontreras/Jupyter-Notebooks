I_H8_bots,"If you're serious about this post, and I hope you are, you'll review the following:

/u/B0tRank - a replacement for the thankfully dead goodbot_badbot, nothing but spam, encourages users to spam

/u/good-Human_Bot - More spam on top of botrank, helps to generate massive comment chains of good bot, good human, botrank paragraphs, bad bot, etc..

/u/CommonMisspellingBot - been running for over a year with minutely comments containing passive aggressive callouts on typos and horrible spelling 'tips'. Doesn't delete when you reply delete as instructed in the bot's footer, no way to contact the creator/maintainer.

/u/opfeels - spam

/u/hotdog_bot - really nincompoopian spam

/u/AlexaPlayBot and /u/_\_\_alexa\_\_\_ - two bots that do the exact same spammy thing

​/u/Wutbot1 - Takes comments from posts and reposts them on similar posts. Adds nothing but spam.

/u/PORTMANTEAU-BOT - Owner hasn't even posted on reddit in three months, but he left his bot that replies to two word comments running just for us.",17,e4pl018
