Watchful1,"I did a bit of research.

Looks like this is a redesign feature. The links are available for every post, both in the post itself and in the listings. A get request to this post

    wget https://new.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/b5imrq/reddit_now_provides_a_web_socket_for_fetching/

includes the script tags with all the post data, including the `liveCommentsWebsocket` attribute.

Each link is in the format

    wss://ws-05ca86577a8823343.wss.redditmedia.com/link/7w17su?m=AQAAu7aaXCrus34otS3tYMNKfNqjeL79N5jsTJCIGhkAIbbKFeqx\

with three ids/keys. `05ca86577a8823343`, `7w17su`, `AQAAu7aaXCrus34otS3tYMNKfNqjeL79N5jsTJCIGhkAIbbKFeqx`. The first one is sometimes the same between posts, the second is the post id, the third is unique every time. It appears the websocket works anonymously, I didn't need to pass credentials to access it and I got the same link regardless of whether I make the original request logged in or not.

Unfortunately it does seem like it's only on a per post basis, so unless you're willing to open thousands of connections at once I don't think it will be all that useful for ingesting comments. I bet reddit is planning on using it to auto-update comments in threads, so unless they are willing to go the extra mile for us developers, I doubt they would have any use for a reddit wide one.",8,eje8vmf

Stuck_In_the_Matrix,"Ahhh -- thank you for doing the research though! It's always cool to discover things like this :)
