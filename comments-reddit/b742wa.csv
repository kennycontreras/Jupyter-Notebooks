A reddit client ID is NOT automatically attached to any particular account. You need to tell PRAW to use your client ID, and IoI_xD's username/password, to sign in as that account. If you want to use a different account with a personal use script, add it as a developer using the ""add developers"" form field on the [app page](/prefs/apps).",6,ejp7ygb
