rhinodiablo,"Thank you very much for your comment and the code that you've provided. I executed it, but its stuck, as in its processing and its been more than 15 minutes its just doing that. I tried restarting but its still the same, its still processing. My computer isn't slow, but maybe its just my computer. I appreciate your code a lot. And even in the case where it won't work, you've given me the logic of the code that I needed, I should be able to tinker the code and make it work. I can't afford actual reddit gold to give you, because I want to, so [here is some virtual reddit gold for you](https://imgur.com/gallery/DGRaPQs) :D ",1,ek9t0xd
