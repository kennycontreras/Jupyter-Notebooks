Once I've cleaned it up in a few weeks~1mo (depending on how much time I have), I'll likely open source it though. Finding a second sub to test on will be pretty helpful in that as well.

Ambiwlans,"Right now it is only reporting comments. Though I have a setting for automated removal with a high enough confidence level.

You'd actually like our sub mod handling (mostly, though you might not like the rule set) I think. All removals come with a pm notification. Unlike the admins in r/redesign who seem to remove your threads without notification. Our automated removals additionally send the team a modmail, to ensure that we have very few false removals (they are usually for really toxic things or posts that violate the criminal code).

Anti-evil and admin silent removals/shadowbans has been interesting actually. A few years ago it was something like 1/10000 comments was hidden/removed by admins, and now it is slightly over 1/1000. Looking at a few dozen of them, I didn't see any that were accurate/fair removals, most qualified as 'good' comments in our fairly strict sub.

I'm super curious how well it'd function in that sub, haha. In r/SpaceX it catches a lot of 'fighty' aggressive language. But in that sub, it would be allowed (and is kind of the point) except in certain contexts.

Watchful1,"LPT, if you're trying to get an engineering job and you send your github profile to them in your resume, it looks really good to have a long history of commits rather than just finishing a project and publishing it all at once. I've been publishing my projects as I write them for years and in that time I've only had one person gently criticize some half formed design decisions I made.

I see this over and over with new programmers. Don't be embarrassed by your bad code. Being comfortable with tools like git and using them often to push your changes is a really big help.",2,ek6vjef
shaggorama,"It sounds like you're only using one subreddit for your training set, so this approach will likely be very useful for that subreddit but there are no guarantees that the types of content /r/spacex wants removed overlaps with what other subreddits wants removed. You should try to cluster the content being removed to construct different classifiers to moderate different types of content. If you're using a neural network, you could treat the top layer as terminal features and cluster comments in this feature space to hopefully capture different ""reasons"" the model learned to moderate content.",2,ek6oavq
FreeSpeechWarrior,"> You'd actually like our sub mod handling (mostly, though you might not like the rule set) I think. All removals come with a pm notification.

Thats certainly an improvement over standard reddit moderation, but it does little to educate the general public as to how often your team intervenes in discussions.

You might consider u/modlogs or u/publicmodlogs to take the next step there.

> Our automated removals additionally send the team a modmail, to ensure that we have very few false removals

That's a pretty good counterbalance combined with a high confidence threshold.

The admins should bring back some sort of deputy moderation system like that given their [clumsy use of automated tech.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/b9fpe9/why_is_reddit_instituting_word_filters_on_active/) that they [deny ever using](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/b5ii9k/why_are_the_antievil_operations_admins_removing/ejfsy7t/)

> I don't think that your subs get enough traffic for the bot to work there though. Thanks for the interest either way :D

Well let me clarify what I'm looking for because I think maybe this could be worked out.

The subs I'd be interested in using this in, typically have little to no rules of their own; and my interest in this bot is for highlighting content that might trigger the admins increasingly fragile sensibilities in an effort to avoid a subreddit ban hammer or quarantine.  (this content should not be subreddit specific)

As you've mentioned, reddit has stepped up their own censorship on these grounds so I think such a system could see a lot of demand.

For this use case; being trained only on a specific subreddit may not be as desirable or beneficial; perhaps it could be trained on a more general corpus of reddit ham and a corpus of comments censored by or in service of the admins.

If so, then this would bring utilitity to even smaller subreddits.",1,ek6qsd1
AwwFoxes,"> A few years ago it was something like 1/10000 comments was hidden/removed by admins, and now it is slightly over 1/1000.

I'd say even a few months ago. Before that the admins banned subs they didn't like and had the powermods do the censoring in individual subs. It wasn't until the banout 2018 that the admins suddenly started actively removing things in other subs. Before that admin intervention was practically unheard of.

And I agree, most of the comments they remove aren't breaking the rules at all. They merely criticize Reddit Inc., the admins, the powermods, or share a view that an admin disagrees with.",1,ek6ufl3
pulsar512b,"Yeah, I'm certainly interested what it will flag. I'd guess it would mostly grab comments like the ones posted by new users, due to our automod setup.",1,ek6v645
Ambiwlans,"True enough. I'm not really a new programmer, I just took a scenic route the past several years :S .... This was my 'relearn how to program' project since it seemed more interesting than Hello World. Putting it on github would have been some really unnecessary overhead.

I think my next project I might do with git from the start... it is just annoying as a solo coder.",1,ek6vudl
Ambiwlans,"Yeah, different subs are so different with totally different rules that I don't think there is much point in generalizing that way. Most subs will ban sexism/racism but that is the easiest stuff to find anyways.

A new RF would need to be fitted for each subreddit that wants to use the system.

Currently it doesn't do any clustering, but I was considering clustering after the fact. It wouldn't be nicely labelled data but it might help mod teams understand why certain comments got reported.

I'm using a random forest atm, not a NN. Mostly for speed/simplicity reasons.",1,ek6p0j1
Ambiwlans,"We also do occasional meta threads where we give some of the information that modlogs shows. To give general stats and a random sample of removed stuff (filtered for truly bad stuff, some of the bad comments we get come with jail time to repeat for ITAR violations) so it would be very difficult to handle that.

>The subs I'd be interested in using this in, typically have little to no rules of their own; and my interest in this bot is for highlighting content that might trigger the admins increasingly fragile sensibilities in an effort to avoid a subreddit ban hammer or quarantine

Ah, it wouldn't be useful for that. A much simpler bot that collects/flags admin removed content would be more useful for you. I think that'd be most interesting in a giant sub like r/politics. I'm sure they have dozens of admin removed comments each day.",1,ek6s3tt
Ambiwlans,"I honestly didn't notice anything that was anti-reddit anti-admin either.

Just perfectly normal comments from normal people that like spaceflight. I can't check shadowbanned user's post history though, just the comment before me, so maybe they said something in the past.",1,ek6unnn

Though some people seem to have all their comments removed but you can still go to their account  ... I have no idea what criteria people get shadowbanned for or why there are so many variations.
