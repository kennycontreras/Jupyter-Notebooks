LordKeren,"Hm, it appears reddit isn't showing [removed] any more. I'm not sure if this is an A/B test, or it's site wide. 

These comments are removed by moderators or automod, but they're not coming up as [removed] anymore, they're just not appearing at all.

You can look at some of the undelete sites to see that the 'load more comments' is hiding the removed comments, though clicking load more doesn't cause the [removed] tags to come up as it has before.

Watchful1,"Reddit doesn't always promptly update the comment trees of posts when a comment is deleted/removed. So the comment tree has a marker saying ""there are X more comments here"", but when you try to load them, reddit tells you they don't exist anymore. Sometimes you can load a comment tree that consists of nothing but deleted/removed comments, but usually you can't.

It's happened as long as I can remember, I don't think it's a new thing. There's nothing you can really do to prevent the problem. Just add a ""there's nothing here"" popup or something so people don't think they did something wrong.",1,ek1fagh
MagikarpUsedSurf,"Actually on Apollo, sometimes I hit load more comment it shows nothing but if I press back and go into the post again, I could load it and read them like normal",1,ek2nbug
LordKeren,"update:

Confirmed, they're removed comments. Reddit isn't showing [removed] anymore.

First two images is how it looks to normal users. Last is how it looks for moderators ",3,ek126qh
iamthatis,"Oh okay, yeah I see what you're saying (and thanks btw). If I use one of those sites that keeps a cache of removed comments (not condoning) I can see that they were indeed existing at some point.",1,ek1395x
iamthatis,"Yeah Apollo has a bug of its own that I fixed there, definitely not 100% this.",1,ek2nd6j
kemitche,Full branches of deleted/removed comments have always been pruned from comment trees when presented to the API / site.,7,ek12ev3
MagikarpUsedSurf,"Responding at the speed of light, I love it lol. Yeah I haven't seeen that bug so far in the new version, but thanks anyway!",1,ek2nhjp
LordKeren,Interesting. I never tied together that this occurs only when the whole branch is missing,3,ek12vsp
iamthatis,"So it basically is the fact that they've been pruned, but after whatever generates ""Load x more comments"" has occurred? So the button is basically trying to load the pruned comments? I assume there's no way to prevent the button showing up in these cases, because you'd have to manually check if they're pruned first?",2,ek1370u
iamthatis,"Oh haha it still should be in the new version, I fixed it a few hours ago, I'll ship it out soon :P",1,ek2niji
kemitche,"That all sounds correct, yup.",1,ek13bnf
iamthatis,"Okay, thank you!",1,ek13lqh
