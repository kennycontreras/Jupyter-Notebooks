Watchful1,It's not possible reliably stream r/all. Comments are posted to reddit quite fast and you can just sometimes miss them. I would recommend using pushshift to search for the data you want instead.,4,ej7jh0y
Klamocalypse,"How are you checking if your comment is detected? Maybe do a direct author id check

    ...
    for comment in subreddit.stream.comments():
        if comment.author.id == reddit.user.me().id:
            print(""Found my comment id"", comment.id,"" in the post url"", comment.submission.url)
        ...",2,ej6qz8f
Klamocalypse,Log out of your username and see if you can see your comments and posts on that subreddit anonymously? Just to check if you aren't shadowbanned.,1,ej6qr1h

    params={'before': before_attribute}

with

    params={'before': None}

in `models/util.py` of the praw package and see if you notice any difference?",1,ej6uah8
OsrsNeedsF2P,I've actually been having this very issue. How do bots like RemindMe or the spelling mistake one do it?,1,ej7oulj
td_brokeit,"This is annoying. 

My bot tracks the use of common phrases across Reddit, and searches to see if they are present in a comment. I was (and still am, though not for long) streaming all new comments, so this potentially means I'm losing thousands of hits worth of data. 

Rewrite time!

td_brokeit,"I've tried a few things. One was spitting out every username that made a comment in a program to the console, and while that was running, posting a comment. I let it run for a moment longer, stop the program, and then used the Windows `CTRL+F` to search for my own username, which did not appear. In the end version of the program, it's going to do this, with a bit of tweaking so it can accept arguments:

```
if submission.body.lower() == "">>commenttrends"":
    submission.author.message(""TestMessage"", ""This is a test message from u/commentTrendsBot."")
    print(""This is a thing and this thing happened {} {}"".format(submission, submission.subreddit))
```

Granted I think the string to send a PM is wrong anyway, but the issue is that is not triggering, because my comments with `>>commenttrends` are not picked up.",1,ej6r6uz
td_brokeit,"They're there, I should have mentioned I've already tested for that.",1,ej6qs4v
td_brokeit,What does this do?,1,ej6uckh
Watchful1,"No idea how the spelling mistake bot works, but RemindMe uses pushshift to search for the keyword.",1,ej7pfeh
Watchful1,"If you really do need to get the text of every single comment, pushshift would be better since you can fetch batches 1000 at a time instead of 100. But it does have its own rate limits and the owner of the service plans to have more restrictive rate limits in the future.

You could try to replicate how pushshift ingests data. There's a high level article about it [here](https://pushshift.io/ingesting-data%e2%80%8a-%e2%80%8ausing-high-performance-python-code-to-collect-data/), but it still would take a fair amount of work, even if you aren't trying to save all the comments into a searchable database like pushshift does.

If you just want to play around with historical data, you can bulk download comments a month at a time [here](https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/comments/), but it's a lot of data.",1,ej8bels
Klamocalypse,"Is your submission a reddit ""Submission"" aka a post, or a comment?",1,ej6rlcy
Pyprohly,"There’s supposedly been a reliability drop in PRAW’s streaming capacity, according to a recent [issue reported on GitHub](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/issues/1043).

The edit I suggested you should try is based on my speculation of why a simple requests script out performs a PRAW streaming one: PRAW does some suboptimal “`before` param adjusting” that’s unsuitable for fast listings such as comments from r/all.

PRAW has the capacity to pull in comments at a rate of 100/s, and reddit comments from r/all come in at an [average rate of about 75/s](https://pushshift.io), so it’s theoretically possible to keep up with r/all comments using a stream.

td_brokeit,"Ok, I've changed that line, ~~and I don't think it made any difference.~~

It worked, I think. I'm going to need to do some more testing, but it appears to have picked up a few test comments I made on my subreddit. Cheers for the suggestion, I'll report back when I've done some more testing.",1,ej99nfa
Klamocalypse,"I don't see why the issues are occurring, is the bot currently running?",1,ej6t86h
